Personal loans are a lucrative revenue stream for banks. The typical interest rate of a two-year loan in the United Kingdom is around 10%. This might not sound like a lot, but in September 2022 alone UK consumers borrowed around £1.5 billion, which would mean approximately £300 million in interest generated by banks over two years!

in the conext with a collaboration with a  bank, cleaning the data they collected as part of a recent marketing campaign is needed, which aimed to get customers to take out a personal loan. They plan to conduct more marketing campaigns going forward so would like  to ensure it conforms to the specific structure and data types that they specify so that they can then use the cleaned data provided to set up a PostgreSQL database, which will store this campaign's data and allow data from future campaigns to be easily imported.
